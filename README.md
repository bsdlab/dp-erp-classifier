# ERP Classifier

This is a general ERP classifier module. It is built in the context of refactoring the [auditory aphasia](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8846581/) setup.
The initial core functionality will be based in [Toeplitz LDA](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ac9c98).
